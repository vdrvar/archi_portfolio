The serious part:

A trilingual Machine Learning Engineer with hands-on experience in developing and fine-tuning algorithms for various industries, including finance, AI, and energy. Skilled in applying machine learning techniques like transformers, NLP, and graph neural networks to solve real-world problems. Proficient in Python, C++, and other programming languages, with a strong background in mathematics and data science, supported by degrees from top EU universities. Known for improving efficiency, automating tasks, and delivering practical solutions that save costs and add value. Experienced in both research and real-world applications, with a solid track record of successful projects and publications.

The human part:

When I’m not coding, you can probably find me reading (I read all kinds of stuff), learning languages (not immediately useful for SWE, but I’m pretty sure it tickles the creative part of your brain that indirectly helps), running (ran a marathon while doing my internship at Citigroup), or playing tennis (still improving :/). I also often think about when I’ll have time to get back to playing my piano and guitar (there’s also an idea to create a generative AI tool for music production—I still have to learn a few more things first, though).        </p>

        <div class="project">
            <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/vdrvar/spotify_recommender_system">Spotify Recommender App with Kaggle Data</a>:</strong> A Flask-based web application that provides personalized song recommendations using <strong>cosine similarity</strong> and <strong>RBF similarity</strong>. It integrates with Redis for caching and Docker for deployment, allowing users to explore songs, receive tailored recommendations, and add songs to a favorites list.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="project">
            <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/vdrvar/comp_vision_for_soda_bottles">Computer Vision for Soda Bottles</a>:</strong> A deep learning project applying <strong>transfer learning</strong> to recognize soda bottle brands using a fine-tuned Xception model. The system achieves a 94% accuracy rate, leveraging the Kaggle Cola Bottle Identification Dataset. It also includes a FastAPI interface for image uploads and predictions, allowing users to interact with the model via a web interface.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="project">
            <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/vdrvar/java_ml_text_processor">Java ML Text Processor</a>:</strong> A Java-based NLP application that uses <strong>Apache OpenNLP</strong> and JavaFX to provide a GUI for text processing. The app performs tokenization, sentence detection, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition (NER), with the ability to export processed text. It’s designed as an educational tool for interacting with basic NLP techniques.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="project">
            <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/vdrvar/julia_image_autoencoder">Julia Image Autoencoder</a>:</strong> This project uses <strong>Flux.jl</strong> in Julia to build an autoencoder for compressing and decompressing images. The system processes batches of images, compresses them into a lower-dimensional space, and reconstructs them with minimal loss. The project focuses on learning compact image representations, with examples of original and reconstructed images included.</p>
